## Purpose

This project consists in a **slideshow** which aims to present a scientific paper about the performance of the **PageRank** algorithm in directed, unweighted networks with strong **temporal patterns**.

This project has been made for the oral exam of the course of *[Complessit√† nei Sistemi e nelle Reti](http://home.deib.polimi.it/piccardi/csr.html)*, held by [prof. Carlo Piccardi](http://home.deib.polimi.it/piccardi/) in Politecnico di Milano.
