\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Important findings}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mismatch between relevance and activity decay timescales leads to \alert{time bias} in PageRank:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item towards recent nodes if decay of relevance is faster
            \item towards old nodes if decay of activity is faster
        \end{itemize}
        \item PageRank can underperform w.r.t. \alert{indegree ranking}
        \item Findings are \alert{robust} with respect to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item form of decay function
            \item distribution of fitness among the nodes
            \item metric used to evaluate the algorithm
        \end{itemize}
        \item Link \alert{timestamps} are crucial for this analysis
        \item Method not applicable to undirected networks
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{In conclusion\ldots}
    \begin{quote}
        PageRank, despite its popularity and robustness, \alert{can fail} and thus it should not be used without \alert{carefully considering the temporal properties of the system} to which it is to be applied.
